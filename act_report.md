# Analyzing WeRateDogs Tweets

---

## Introduction

The Twitter account [WeRateDogs]( https://twitter.com/dog_rates ) took the world by storm with the popular meme "they're good dogs Brent" back in 2016. Today with over 8 million followers worldwide, the account is known for the adorable dogs they feature as well as they're unique rating system of how good of boys and girls they are. I mean, how could you not love it with faces like these:

So they may not be the greatest at math, but people don't seem to mind. Honestly I don't either, I mean they're such good dogs. But after tweeting over 10K photos of the most adorable floofers, I wonder if these ratings have some legs after all. And being that we live in a world of measurement  and tracking, I'm curious if there are any connections that can be found between the dogs featured and the response by the Twitter audience. Heck it'd be cool if there were data collected from a neural network that I could somehow use, I mean that's such a hot buzz word right now. I know what you're thinking, "Alex, but that's two words." Well you're right, that is two words. And I just so happen to have that data and will be analyzing that so let's do it.
